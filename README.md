### Challenge: [Data Driven IoT Insights for sustainable communities](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/data_driven_iot_insights_for_sustainable_communities)   

Ideas:- 
- parking made easy
- TinyML edge computing and blockchain  
- Using IoTs in hospitals...ICUs to know vacancies or iot per patient and unique id being generated and connected to an app so that doctors and family members can have info about vitals of the patient,likewise abilityt to record patient's info.  
- Likewise with pharmacies and connected to one app.  
- Install devices in factories where chemicals are made like recent lebanon accident and check for meteorological factors like temperature of room and automatically 
  alert relevant authorities.  
- Also use to prevent bushfires.  
- To be prepared for pandemics like corona[netflix credits](https://www.netflix.com/au/title/81273378)
  - there are about 1.5M viruses in the pandemic we are unaware about, preventing zoonotic virus like covid19.  
  - For decades zoonotic viruses are causing outbreaks with no vaccines for treatement.  
    Ex: SARSCOV2002 and MERS2012 coronaviruses, that killed in 100s.   
  - And then there is epidemic like covid-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which occured almost after a century and has killed in 1000s.    
    covid-19 is the disease.SARS-CoV-2  is the virus.  
  - There are 7 types of coronaviruses known among which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are detrimental than HCoV

  - Viruses like these need a host to survive like us,humans and their chance of survival increases if the host doesn't fall sick.
    For instance, the virus that caused covid-19 is often paired with bats in the news and other media because amalgamated with bats and did not bother them,however, there are debilitating effects when such a virus intrudes into the human world, and is insidious during the transmission.  
    This is exactly what happened with SARS in 2002, it emerged in an animal market in China where the meat being sold was infected when the animal made contact with a bat infected with SARS.  
    Since then [**EcoHealth Alliance**](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/personnel/dr-peter-daszak), a scientific group is making errands to bat caves in southern china and examining bats for coronaviruses, and alert the public. The process is risky...IoT can interfere here and help in expediting.  A few years back researchers found a low-risk virus in bats called RaTG13 and later moved on since it did not impose any risk to humans, now while genome sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 they found a 96% match with the RaTG13 virus..they believe SARS-CoV-2 evolved from RaTG13.    
    *The researchers were looking for SARS family of virus and thus overlooked RaTG13.It is impossible to predict all forms of evolution of a virus.*  
 - So how did it evolve?
     - The virus might have mutated by jumping from bats to some other animal/reptile/fish before getting to humans.  
     The closest virus similar to  SARS-CoV-2 was in 1918 when a bird with a flu and a human with a flu met the same pig. The human virus and bird virus combined in a cell of the pig and produced **H1N1**
     
 - Organisations like WHO have limited resources and work on voluntray fundings, they elicited a blueprint in 2005 harbingering a pandemic of such a scale, and later in September 2019 again a WHO report warned of an outbreak due to a respiratory pathogen but none took heed due to inadequate use of information.
 
 - Early precautions can stop the spread by as much as 95%  
 ### Actual status of disease spread
